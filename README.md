# GitHub Webhooks

GitHub Webhooks notify an external service when a specific event (e.g., push, pull request, issue update) happens in a repository.

## Create a Webhook

1. Go to your GitHub repository.
2. Click Settings â†’ Webhooks.
3. Click Add webhook.
4. Set the Payload URL (where GitHub will send the event data).
5. Choose the Content type (application/json or application/x-www-form-urlencoded).
6. Select the events you want to trigger the webhook.
7. Click Add webhook.

## Run the Server

```bash
node server.js
```

## Expose your server to the internet using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/)

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

Use the generated <https://xyz.ngrok.io> URL as your Payload URL in the GitHub webhook settings.
## Testing Webhook
1. Push a commit to your GitHub repo.
2. The server should log the event data.

## Create a Pre-Commit Hook

Edit or create .git/hooks/pre-commit and add:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
echo "Running pre-commit hook..."
npm run lint
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Linting failed. Fix errors before committing."
  exit 1
fi
```

## Make it executable

```bash
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

## Test the Hook

Try committing:

```bash
git commit -m "Test commit"
```

If linting fails, the commit will be rejected.
